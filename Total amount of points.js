Our football team finished the championship. The result of each match look like "x:y". 
Results of all matches are recorded in the collection.
For example: ["3:1", "2:2", "0:1", ...]
Write a function that takes such collection and counts the points of our team in the championship. 
Rules for counting points for each match:
if x>y - 3 points
if x<y - 0 point
if x=y - 1 point
Notes:
there are 10 matches in the championship
0 <= x <= 4
0 <= y <= 4
